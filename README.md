ChipinCSS is a powerful and customization capable CSS library, with everything you wanted outside of it! It comes with many styles, color modes, styling elements, and many more. The library is all open-source, so you can modify it yourself!

## Installing

Installing the framework is very simple and straightforward. You can install it with our CDN network, using NodeJS, or downloading our precompiled version. There are some requirements you should have first.

* JQuary
* PopperJS

To start off, download the precompiled files, and store them in a folder or your own CDN network. You should always have this layout:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>My website</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

When you have the files unpacked, add these lines to your HTML file.

```html
<link href="/path/to/your/files/chipinCSS/main.css" rel="stylesheet">

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Save the file, and reload the page. Now you have ChipinCSS installed on your website! Lets get to customizing it.
